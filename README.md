# Instagram-Scraper
Scrapes Images and stores them in a file.

This is created using Selenium. This requires chrome selenium webdriver and active chrome version <=99.0

The code takes in username and password of the user, and the username of the account they want to scrape.

Comments are added, which explains how the whole code works. The folder to which the csv links are saved are also added. The code outputs a Instagram Scraper notebook outputs a csv file containing all the links of the accounts photos. The next script will help to iterate through these csvs and save them in the folder of your choice.
